## Purpose

Use this folder to store plugins you'd like to copy over into the Docker container. Plugins will not be tracked by version control, so you'll need to manage that for individual plugins.

## Copying themes

To copy all themes and plugins to the docker container, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

To watch for changes, run:

```
npm run dev
```
